# SwiftCharts

[The Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) says 

>Swift Charts is a powerful and concise SwiftUI framework for transforming your data into informative visualizations.
With Swift Charts, you can build effective and customizable charts with minimal code. This framework provides marks, scales, axes, and legends as building blocks that you can combine to develop a broad range of data-driven charts.



We can create different varieties of Charts using the framework. There are several types of Charts; Area, Line, Point, Rectangle, Rule, and Bar.
These Charts are easy to use and are customizable with ease. I am adding some screenshots about the practice of Charts.

I have recently added a new Chart. Practicing for Sector Chart...
